Meme the Dream is a browser game that turns boredom while waiting in line into a fun, active challenge by having players match meme poses using their webcam. You play as Kyle, a high schooler battling raccoons with perfectly timed meme poses across three levels of increasing difficulty. The game uses MediaPipe for privacy-safe pose detection and scores your accuracy with a “Kyle Factor” percentage, complete with entertaining sound effects. It’s a quick, playful way to get moving, laugh, and break up the monotony of everyday waits.
